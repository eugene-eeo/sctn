# sctn

A bastardised spelling of the word intersection. Written
in Rust and mainly an excuse for myself to learn to work
with Cargo and the nice features and type system. It returns
the lines common to all strings, but ordered with respect
to the last string. Usage:

```shell
$ sctn -h
$ sctn "$(command1)" "$(command2)" ...
```
